# CycleGAN-DeRain
This project applies CycleGAN for image-to-image translation between two domains, focusing on rain removal. It uses a U-Net generator with skip connections to preserve details and a PatchGAN discriminator to evaluate local realism, enabling clear and realistic outputs from rainy images.
